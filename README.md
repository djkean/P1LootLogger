# PokeOne LootLogger (P1LL)

### P1LL is a work in progress, expecting to be ready very soon!

P1LL is a project with the idea of providing the game of PokeOne and it's community with a resource to used to collect and represent that collected data in a meaningful way. Many well established games and media have in-depth Wikis and resources that catalogue content, story, history and other intricate details regarding their subject, but I think there's room for both more data and representation of it in the PokeOne community.

The goal is to create a site the crowdfunds the user's data to better detail what players can expect to get from taking part in the game, allowing players to report the rewards they get and collecting it to use as a reference. Players will be able to use this information to see how likely they are to get specific rewards, or look up specific rewards to see where and how they can try to earn them.

Inspiration for this project came from a personal interest in information I couldn't reliably find, and the realization that this could be a great opportunity to learn how to provide the solution to my own problem, and hopefully for anyone else who may be looking for the same information I couldn't find.
