         PokeOne Loot Logger is a community driven, crowdsourced tool meant 
         to let players help players - by reporting their loot and breaking 
         down the numbers for both them and others. You can view stats and 
         loot tables for your favourites bosses without an account, but users 
         looking to help report data will need to create an account first.
